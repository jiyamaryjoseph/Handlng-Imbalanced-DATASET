# Handlng-Imbalanced-Dataset.(such as fraud event, payment default, spam)
Here I am using many technique for handling imbalanced dataset.


## Introduction
When working with an imbalanced classification problem, we are usually more concerned with correctly predicting the minority class (also called the positive class), e.g., fraud event, payment default, spam, etc. In other words, it is more critical for us to reduce the number of false negatives (e.g., classifying a fraudulent transaction as non-fraudulent) than false positives (e.g., classifying a normal email as spam).
